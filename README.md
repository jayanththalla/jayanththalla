# Hi, I'm Jayanth 👋

I build full-stack web applications and ship working products that solve real problems.

Most of my work is hands-on: real code, clean architecture, and production-ready setups for MERN apps, REST APIs, payment integrations, OAuth flows, and performance-optimized UIs.

I've delivered 8+ production applications for clients, contributed to open-source at scale, and built award-winning systems recognized at IIT Hyderabad, VIT AP, and UNESCO-level expos.
